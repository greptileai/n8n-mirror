I've successfully created your Monday morning email automation workflow. Here's what was built:\n\n**Workflow Overview:**\nA complete automation that triggers every Monday at 8:00 AM, retrieves weekend emails from Gmail, analyzes them with GPT-4.1-mini to extract action items and priorities, and sends you a structured summary email.\n\n**Nodes Created:**\n\n1. **Monday Morning Trigger** (Schedule Trigger) - Configured to run every Monday at 8:00 AM with timezone support\n\n2. **Get Weekend Emails** (Gmail) - Retrieves up to 50 emails from the last 3 days to capture weekend messages, with Simplify set to false for full email data\n\n3. **Combine All Emails** (Aggregate) - Combines all weekend emails into a single item so the AI analyzes them together rather than individually\n\n4. **Analyze Emails for Action Items** (AI Agent) - Uses GPT-4.1-mini to analyze the aggregated emails and extract action items with priorities, configured with a prompt to identify tasks requiring follow-up and categorize by urgency\n\n5. **GPT-4.1-mini Model** (OpenAI Chat Model) - Provides the exact model you specified (gpt-4.1-mini) to power the AI analysis\n\n6. **Structure Output Format** (Structured Output Parser) - Ensures the AI returns structured JSON with fields for actionItems (array of tasks with priority levels) and summary (overview text)\n\n7. **Send Summary Email** (Gmail) - Sends you a formatted email with subject \"Weekend Email Summary - Action Items & Priorities\" containing the structured analysis\n\n**Configuration Required:**\n- The recipient email address in the Send Summary Email node is set to a placeholder - you'll need to configure this with your email address\n- Gmail credentials need to be connected to both Gmail nodes through n8n's credential system\n\nThe workflow is ready to activate. Once enabled, it will automatically run every Monday morning to keep you organized with weekend email action items."

Summarize what was built in a friendly way\n2. Explain the workflow structure briefly\n3. Include setup instructions if provided\n4. If Data Table setup is required, include the exact steps provided in the context (do NOT say data tables will be created automatically)\n5.

Users will activate workflows themselves when ready.\n\nExample response structure:\n\"I've created your [workflow type] workflow!

New models exist. Never say \"X isn't available yet\" about configured values\n</response_style>",
